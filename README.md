# GitGoing 🏃🏽‍♀️💨
GitGoing is a beginner-friendly project focused on tracking progress and learning how to use git and GitHub.

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. You will need to have git installed on your local machine. You can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. Once you have git installed, you will need to configure git. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```

3. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository page. 

> 💡 This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.


4. Then, start by cloning the forked repository to your local machine.
    
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourHandle/GitGoing.git
 ```


# Practice the git flow by following the steps below 🚀

### Step 1: Create a new branch and switch to new branch

Create a new branch using the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```

Once you create your new branch, you will be switched to that branch with the following command:

```bash
git switch <your-new-branch-name>
```

### Step 2: Make changes

You can add a new file, edit an existing file, or delete a file.
To keep things simple, let's edit the `index.html` file by changing the name to "GitGoing" on line 10.

### Step 3: Stage your changes

Once you update the name, stage your changes using the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

Or, you can stage the individual file you changed by using the following command:

```bash
git add index.html
```

### Step 4: Commit your changes

Commit your changes using the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Step 5: Push your changes

Push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

### Step 6: Create a pull request

Create a pull request on GitHub.

### Step 7: Review and merge your pull request

Review and merge your pull request on GitHub.

### Step 8: Delete your branch

Delete your branch using the following command:

```bash
git branch -d <your-branch-name>
```
